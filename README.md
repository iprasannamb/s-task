## File Structure

```
Project Directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ init.py          # Main application file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task.txt         # Auto-generated task storage file
```

## Data Format

Tasks are stored in `task.txt` with the following format:
```
Buy groceries-False
Complete project-True
```

**Format breakdown:**
- Task description comes before the dash
- Status is either `True` (Done) or `False` (Not Done)

## Notes

- Tasks are automatically saved when added
- The application creates `task.txt` if it doesn't exist
- Empty input or typing 'exit' will stop the task addition process
- Task numbers start from 1 for user convenience
